## My process
To be able to complete this simple challenge, I had to write the essential mark up on HTML, and proceed to do the neccessary styles by using Bootstrap and CSS. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I am practically new to Bootstrap but I wanted to practice it more, because it is easier to do responsive websites with it, to be able to deliver a functional and good-looking view on Mobile and Desktop.

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/) - This helped me a lot to deliver this simple project, I am using this version for now but then I will be using the newest version going forward.
